<p>One of the interesting tensions in the crypto space, which has become a sort of digital home for my geographically nomadic self over the last decade, is its relationship to the topic of governance. The crypto space hails from the cypherpunk movement, which values independence from external constraints often imposed by ruthless and power-hungry politicians and corporations, and has for a long time built technologies like torrent networks and encrypted messaging to achieve these ends. With newer ideas like blockchains, cryptocurrencies and DAOs, however, there is an important shift: these newer constructions are long-lived, and constantly evolving, and so they have an inherent need to build their own governance, and not just circumvent the governance of unwanted outsiders. The ongoing survival of these structures depends crucially on mathematical research, open source software, and other large-scale public goods. This requires a shift in mentality: the ideology that maintains the crypto space needs to transcend the ideology that created it.</p>
<p>These kinds of complex interplays between coordination and freedom, especially in the context of newer technologies, are everywhere in our modern society, going far beyond blockchains and cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that would ban synthetic (aka "lab-grown") meat from the state, arguing that "global elites want to control our behavior and push a diet of petri dish meat and bugs on Americans", and that we need to "prioritize our farmers and ranchers over ... the World Economic Forum".
