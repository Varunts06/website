<p>Over the past two years, STARKs have become a crucial and irreplaceable technology for efficiently making easy-to-verify cryptographic proofs of very complicated statements (eg. proving that an Ethereum block is valid). A key reason why is small field sizes: whereas elliptic curve-based SNARKs require you to work over 256-bit integers in order to be secure enough, STARKs let you use much smaller field sizes, which are more efficient: first the Goldilocks field (64-bit integers), and then Mersenne31 and BabyBear (both 31-bit). Thanks to these efficiency gains, Plonky2, which uses Goldilocks, is hundreds of times faster at proving many kinds of computation than its predecessors.</p>
<p>A natural question to ask is: can we take this trend to its logical conclusion, building proof systems that run even faster by operating directly over zeroes and ones? This is exactly what Binius is trying to do, using a number of mathematical tricks that make it very different from the SNARKs and STARKs of three years ago. This post goes through the reasons why small fields make proof generation more efficient, why binary fields are uniquely powerful, and the tricks that Binius uses to make proofs over binary fields work so effectively.

      <p>One of the key tasks of a cryptographic proving system is to operate over huge amounts of data, while keeping the numbers small. If you can compress a statement about a large program into a mathematical equation involving a few numbers, but those numbers are as big as the original program, you have not gained anything</p>
      <p>To do complicated arithmetic while keeping numbers small, cryptographers generally use modular arithmetic. We pick some prime "modulus" p. The % operator means "take the remainder of": 
        , 
        , etc (note that the answer is always non-negative, so for example 
        ).
