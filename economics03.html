<p>Public goods are an incredibly important topic in any large-scale ecosystem, but they are also one that is often surprisingly tricky to define. There is an economist definition of public goods - goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, two technical terms that taken together mean that it's difficult to provide them through private property and market-based means. There is a layman's definition of public good: "anything that is good for the public". And there is a democracy enthusiast's definition of public good, which includes connotations of public participation in decision-making.</p>
<p>But more importantly, when the abstract category of non-excludable non-rivalrous public goods interacts with the real world, in almost any specific case there are all kinds of subtle edge cases that need to be treated differently. A park is a public good. But what if you add a $5 entrance fee? What if you fund it by auctioning off the right to have a statue of the winner in the park's central square? What if it's maintained by a semi-altruistic billionaire that enjoys the park for personal use, and designs the park around their personal use, but still leaves it open for anyone to visit?

    This post will attempt to provide a different way of analyzing "hybrid" goods on the spectrum between private and public: the revenue-evil curve. We ask the question: what are the tradeoffs of different ways to monetize a given project, and how much good can be done by adding external subsidies to remove the pressure to monetize? This is far from a universal framework: it assumes a "mixed-economy" setting in a single monolithic "community" with a commercial market combined with subsidies from a central funder. But it can still tell us a lot about how to approach funding public goods in crypto communities, countries and many other real-world contexts today.
</p><h3>The traditional framework: excludability and rivalrousness</h3>
<p>Let us start off by understanding how the usual economist lens views which projects are private vs public goods. Consider the following examples:</p>
<ul><li>Alice owns 1000 ETH, and wants to sell it on the market.</li>
    <li>Bob runs an airline, and sells tickets for a flight.</li>
    <li>Charlie builds a bridge, and charges a toll to pay for it.</li>
    <li>David makes and releases a podcast.</li>
    <li>Eve makes and releases a song.</li>
    <li>Fred invents a new and better cryptographic algorithm for making zero knowledge proofs.</li>
</ul>
