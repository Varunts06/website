<h3>Defi joins the matching!</h3><hr>
<p>In this round, we were able to have much higher matching values than before. This was because the usual matchings, provided by the Ethereum Foundation and a few other actors, were supplemented for the first time by a high level of participation from various defi projects:</p>
The matchers were:
<ul>
    <li>Chainlink, a smart contract oracle project</li>
<li>Optimism, a layer-2 optimistic rollup</li>
<li>The Ethereum Foundation</li>
<li>Balancer, a decentralized exchange</li>
<li>Synthetix, a synthetic assets platform </li>
</ul>
