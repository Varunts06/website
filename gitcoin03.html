<p>Round 6 of Gitcoin Grants has just finished, with $227,847 in contributions from 1,526 contributors and $175,000 in matched funds distributed across 695 projects. This time around, we had three categories: the two usual categories of "tech" and "community" (the latter renamed from "media" to reflect a desire for a broad emphasis), and the round-6-special category Crypto For Black Lives.

    First of all, here are the results, starting with the tech and community sections:</p>
    <h3>Stability of income</h3>
    <p>In the last round, one concern I raised was stability of income. People trying to earn a livelihood off of quadratic funding grants would want to have some guarantee that their income isn't going to completely disappear in the next round just because the hive mind suddenly gets excited about something else.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A "shopping cart" interface for giving many contributions, with an explicit "repeat your contributions from the last round" feature</li>
        <li>A rule that the matching amounts are calculated using not just contributions from this round, but also "carrying over" 1/3 of the contributions from the previous round (ie. if you made a $10 grant in the previous round, the matching formula would pretend you made a $10 grant in the previous round and also a $3.33 grant this round)</li>
    <li>was clearly successful at one goal: increasing the total number of contributions. But its effect in ensuring stability of income is hard to measure. The effect of (2), on the other hand, is easy to measure, because we have stats for the actual matching amount as well as what the matching amount "would have been" if the 1/3 carry-over rule was not in place.</li>
