<p>Gitcoin Grants Round 9 has just finished, and as usual the round has been a success. Along with 500,000 in matching funds, $1.38 million was donated by over 12,000 contributors to 812 different projects, making this the largest round so far. Not only old projects, but also new ones, received a large amount of funding, proving the mechanism's ability to avoid entrenchment and adapt to changing circumstances. The new East Asia-specific category in the latest two rounds has also been a success, helping to catapult multiple East Asian Ethereum projects to the forefront.

</p>
<p>However, with growing scale, round 9 has also brought out unique and unprecedented challenges. The most important among them is collusion and fraud: in round 9, over 15% of contributions were detected as being probably fraudulent. This was, of course, inevitable and expected from the start; I have actually been surprised at how long it has taken for people to start to make serious attempts to exploit the mechanism. The Gitcoin team has responded in force, and has published a blog post detailing their strategies for detecting and responding to adversarial behavior along with a general governance overview. However, it is my opinion that to successfully limit adversarial behavior in the long run more serious reforms, with serious sacrifices, are going to be required

<h3>Many new, and bigger, funders</h3>

<p>Gitcoin continues to be successful in attracting many matching funders this round. BadgerDAO, a project that describes itself as a "DAO dedicated to building products and infrastructure to bring Bitcoin to DeFi", has donated $300,000 to the matching pool - the largest single donation so far.

</p>
<p>Other new funders include Uniswap, Stakefish, Maskbook, FireEyes, Polygon, SushiSwap and TheGraph. As Gitcoin Grants continues to establish itself as a successful home for Ethereum public goods funding, it is also continuing to attract legitimacy as a focal point for donations from projects wishing to support the ecosystem. This is a sign of success, and hopefully it will continue and grow further. The next goal should be to get not just one-time contributions to the matching pool, but long-term commitments to repeated contributions (or even newly launched tokens donating a percentage of their holdings to the matching pool)!</p>
<h3>Churn continues to be healthy</h3>
<p>One long-time concern with Gitcoin Grants is the balance between stability and entrenchment: if each project's match award changes too much from round to round, then it's hard for teams to rely on Gitcoin Grants for funding, and if the match awards change too little, it's hard for new projects to get included.

    We can measure this! To start off, let's compare the top-10 projects in this round to the top-10 projects in the previous round.</p>
